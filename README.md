# Data-Pooling-Treatment-Roll-Outs
This is the code files for paper: **Synthesizing Evidence: Data-Pooling as a Tool for Treatment Selection in Online Experiments**.
The provided code includes experiments on synthetic data as well as two public experimental datasets, i.e, Criteo dataset and Expedia dataset.
The experiments on synthetic data are located in the Synthetic Experiments folder.


# Synthetic Experiments
1. **Scenario 1 - no feature.ipynb**: This notebook contains the validation code for Scenario 1, which assumes a linear specification, non-overlapping experiments, and excludes feature information.
2. **Scenario 1 - with feature.ipynb**: This notebook contains the validation code for Scenario 1, which assumes a linear specification, non-overlapping experiments, and includes feature information.
3. **Scenario 2.ipynb**: This notebook contains the validation code for Scenario 2, which assumes a non-linear specification and non-overlapping experiments.
4. **Scenario 3.ipynb**: This notebook contains the validation code for Scenario 3, which assumes a linear specification and overlapping experiments.
5. **Scenario 4.ipynb**: This notebook contains the validation code for Scenario 4, which assumes a non-linear specification and overlapping experiments.
6. **Scenario 5.ipynb**: This notebook contains the validation code for Scenario 5, where the underlying policy ATEs are assumed to be non-linear, to evaluate the robustness of our method.
